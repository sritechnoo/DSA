namespace DSA.LeetCode.Graph._841_KeysandRooms
{
    /*There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

    When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

    Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.



    Example 1:

    Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
    Output: true
    Explanation: 
    We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
    We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
    We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
    We then visit room 3.
    Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.

    Example 2:

    Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
    Output: false
    Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.



    Constraints:

        n == rooms.length
        2 <= n <= 1000
        0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000
        1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000
        0 <= rooms[i][j] < n
        All the values of rooms[i] are unique.
