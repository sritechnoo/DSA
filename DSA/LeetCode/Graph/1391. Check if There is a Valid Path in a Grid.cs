    You are given an m x n grid. Each cell of grid represents a street. The street of grid[i][j] can be:

        1 which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.
        2 which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.
        3 which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.
        4 which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.
        5 which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.
        6 which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.

    You will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1). The path should only follow the streets.

    Notice that you are not allowed to change any street.

    Return true if there is a valid path in the grid or false otherwise.
